# Hi there✌
My name is Mattia Moscconi and I'm a software developer and a master's student of computer science and engineering at "Università di Verona", Italy.
In March 2024 I've graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering at "Alma Mater Studiorum - Università degli studi di Bologna".
